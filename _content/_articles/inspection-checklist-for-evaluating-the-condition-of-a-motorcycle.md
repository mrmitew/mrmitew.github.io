As an engineer, I like to learn how things work. And when I was buying my first motorcycle, naturally, I wanted to know what to look for, so that I make my mind whether a potential purchase will worth it or not. 

I have compiled this checklist based on my own experience as well as watching various YouTube videos (I have referenced them at the end).

I tried to group items by area of the bike, with a couple of exceptions.

**Self diagnostics**\*
- [ ] There are no errors
- [ ] No pressure issues with the front and rear break
- [ ] Throttle goes from 0 to 100% and releases back to 0%
- [ ] No issues with the engine, ignition etc

\**For some of the above checks, you might need an extra equipment and/or your bike would need to be able to perform self diagnostics. Consult with your service manual for that and also see what could be checked, note down the possible error codes as well as their meaning and determine what would be a deal breaker for you.*

**Frame**
- [ ] It does not have any cracks
- [ ] It is not not bent
- [ ] The VIN is not scratched or has any signs of being tampered
- [ ] The VIN matches the VIN on the owner's documents

**Fluids**
- [ ] Coolant level is on the maximum level that is appropriate
- [ ] Coolant does not look like it was neglected
- [ ] Oil level is to the maximum
- [ ] Oil does not look like it was neglected
- [ ] Break fluid level is on the maximum level that is appropriate
- [ ] Break fluid does not look like it was neglected
- [ ] Bike is not dripping anything before a ride
- [ ] Bike is not dripping anything after a ride
- [ ] No spots from fluids in the owner's garage

- [ ] Handlebar is straight, not bent

**Break/clutch levers**

- [ ] Levers have free-play
- [ ] Levers pull back when released

Most of these are not deal breakers, but remember, as Ryan from FortNine says,
> If the simple stuff are off-kilter, you can probably assume that the more complicated things are also out of whack.

Take everything into an account when forming your opinion on the bike. It will help you with making a decision whether to proceed with buying it, negotiating a better price or simply passing on the offer.
