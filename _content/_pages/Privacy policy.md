**Analytics**

This website makes use of [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/?hl=en_US), a Google product that helps site and app owners understand how people engage with a service, uses a set of cookies to collect information and report site usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. These insights allow site owners both to improve content and to build better features that improve the userâ€™s experience.

**Advertising** 

This website makes use of [Google Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/), a Google product that allows publishers to earn money from their online content.

Google uses cookies for advertising, including serving and rendering ads, personalizing ads (depending on your ad settings at [g.co/adsettings](https://g.co/adsettings) and your cookie consent choice for this website), limiting the number of times an ad is shown to a user, muting ads you have chosen to stop seeing, and measuring the effectiveness of ads.

Personalized advertising is strictly optional, so you are free to choose whether you want to opt-in or not. If you have previously opted-in by giving a cookie consent in this website, you may follow the instructions for cookie management for your browser, linked above, to opt-out by deleting the `cookie_consent` cookie. Furthermore, if you use Google products, you may visit [Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) of your Google account, to opt-out from personalized advertising for all the websites you visit.

Please keep in mind that visiting a website through an ad, placed on this website, may result in storage of additional cookies either by Google or by the website you're visiting.
