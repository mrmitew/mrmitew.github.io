My name is Stefan Mitev and am a software engineer with: 
 * 7 years of experience with Android mobile development
 * 1/2+ year of experience with Flutter (iOS and Android)
 * 1 year of experience with Android platform/ROM development
 * 1 year of experience with Android Wear development
 * 1/2 year of experience with Android Things development
 * 1 year of experience with microcontrollers and interfacing them with mobile applications
 * 7 years of experience with web (mostly backend) development
 * 3 years of experience with desktop development
 
I graduated _cum laude_ from Fontys University (Netherlands) with a BSc in ICT & Software engineering. Before that I graduated with an excellent diploma in ship navigation from "VMG Sv. Nikolai Chudotvoretz" (Bulgaria) professional maritime highschool.

I believe I inherited my mother's passion for helping others (who was a primary school teacher) and gradually transformed into solving people's problems by building quality software.

Occasionally I would do public speaking on technical topics, related to my professional career, but mainly on Android and Flutter topics. Furthermore, recently I became a co-organizer of "[Flutter Netherlands](https://www.meetup.com/FlutterNL/)", an open developer group, where everybody can share their knowledge about Flutter.

Despite being a software geek, I am also an ex professional athlete. I used to compete in sailing, windsurfing and rowing for 10 years. Recreationally I would do freestyle skating and cycling in the nature. On top of that, I love doing athletic training on a daily basis and whenever possible to travel and explore new places.
